### Contributing Notes
Please please please make sure that there is no trailing whitespace in any
source file when you save it...

As this is an eclipse project, removing trailing whitespace can be done through
going to `Window > preferences > Java > Editor > Save Actions`, then clicking
"configure" and check the checkbox labeled "Removing trailing whitespace"
